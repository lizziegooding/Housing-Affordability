The **U.S. Housing Affordability Tool** provides users with a spatial visualization of the state of U.S. housing affordability for the average single family home, based on the national median income and the federal minimum wage.

Additionally, users may input their current salary to visualize in which U.S. counties they can afford to purchase a home, along with associated interest rates and mortgage data. The tool will pull data from the most recent U.S. census and include a complete list of economic assumptions.

### How to Use ###
Explore the map to see where a household earning $53,482, the national median household income in 2014, can afford to live. Areas shaded blue are locations considered affordable for these households, as they require 30% or less of a householdâ€™s income. Areas shaded red are considered unaffordable.

Use the form on the home page to see where you can afford to buy a home. Then use the tabs at the top right to explore how your income compares to national averages (compare tab) and to customize your assumed housing costs (afford tab).</p>
